/**
 * These tests pin the FACT the 2026-08-05 emoji fix rests on, not the plumbing.
 *
 * The defect was a width disagreement: xterm shipped Unicode 6 widths, where an emoji is ONE cell,
 * while tmux and the agent CLIs measure on a modern table where it is two. Every visible symptom —
 * ⭐ clipped to a sliver in the shared renderer, 👍 overlapping its neighbour in the GPU/DOM ones —
 * followed from that one number, and so does the glyphgrid fix that draws a wide character across
 * both of its cells: without width 2 there is no second cell to draw into.
 *
 * So the number is what gets pinned. An xterm or addon upgrade that quietly moved these back, or a
 * refactor that dropped the activation, would otherwise reintroduce the whole class silently — the
 * kind of regression that only shows up as a screenshot from a device weeks later.
 *
 * Node has no DOM, so the terminal is a stub. That is enough: this file's whole job is to hand a
 * real provider to a real terminal, and the provider is what the assertions interrogate.
