 *
 * It is its own function, with the sinks injected, for one reason: the ORDER of the two calls is
 * a correctness contract and nothing else in the codebase can express it. App.tsx is a component,
 * which the (node-environment) suite cannot render; here the contract is a three-line unit test.

/**
 * Put exactly one renderer in charge.
 *
 * **Never both.** Enabling the shared canvas makes every mounted terminal hand its render service
 * to the glyph addon, and the addon's `setRenderer` silently disposes whatever renderer xterm had
 * — including a budgeted WebGL one, which would leave the coordinator accounting for a context
 * nobody paints with while its release path sweeps a canvas out from under a live attachment.
 * So the outgoing renderer is always taken down BEFORE the incoming one comes up:
 *
 * - into 'shared': reclaim every per-terminal context first (each xterm falls back to its DOM
 *   renderer synchronously), then enable the shared canvas;
 * - out of 'shared': disable the shared canvas first — that notification synchronously detaches
 *   every grid and restores xterm's own renderer — and only then let the budget grant again.
 *
 * Both sinks are change-gated at the source, so the mode that did not change costs one comparison.
