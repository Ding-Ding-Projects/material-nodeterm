// transcript) into the node title, but that poll lives in the mounted TerminalNode: it runs only
// for the ACTIVE project's nodes, in a running desktop UI. Every other node keeps whatever name it
// had when it was last open — and the phone lists ALL of them, so a `/rename` simply never reached
// it (field report: "iPhone'da isimler /rename'den sonra güncellenmiyor").
//
// This sweep runs where the mirror is written (desktop main AND the headless Server Edition), so
// the name is correct with no UI open at all. It only PUBLISHES into the mirror — it never touches
// the workspace file, so the canvas's own title behavior is unchanged.
//
// Everything is injected: no fs, no electron, no timers of its own beyond the interval, so the
// scheduling and the skip rules are unit-testable.
