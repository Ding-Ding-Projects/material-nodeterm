// Executable resolution for a GUI process, without ever spawning a login shell SYNCHRONOUSLY.
//
// A GUI app launched from Finder/Dock inherits only a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:…`) — it
// never sees Homebrew, `~/.local/bin`, nvm, etc. The historical fix was a sync
// `execFileSync($SHELL, ['-lc', 'command -v <bin>'])` per lookup, but sourcing the user's
// profile routinely takes 100-800ms (nvm/conda init) and a synchronous spawn of it sits on the
// MAIN thread — freezing every window, every PTY flush and all IPC for its duration (and the
// tmux-missing banner re-probes on a 3s poll, so it froze repeatedly).
//
// The replacement: resolve the login-shell PATH ONCE, asynchronously (`resolveShellPath`,
// prewarmed at boot), and make every lookup a subprocess-free walk of that cached PATH string
// (`findInPathString` — an accessSync per entry). Callers that run before the async probe has
// settled fall back to the inherited PATH plus their own well-known locations, and simply
// re-probe later (see each caller's memoization notes).
