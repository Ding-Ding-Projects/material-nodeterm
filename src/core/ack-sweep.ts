// Host-side consumer of the phone's read-acks (spec: cross-surface read sync).
//
// The desktop→phone direction (a desktop/browser READ of a finished session → `ackDone` → mirror
// resolve + live-update dismiss) already exists. This module is the phone→host direction: the phone,
// which can write files on the session host as the user, drops a read-ack at
// `~/.nodeterm/acks/<nodeId>.seen` (content = the acked inbox event id, atomic write, umask 077). The
// mirror-owning process sweeps that directory and, for each ack:
//   - calls `ackDone(nodeId)` — resolves the node's done inbox event(s) + fires the end seam so
//     OTHER phones / the phone's own activities sync (same path the desktop-side read uses);
//   - clears the DESKTOP renderer's unread flag for that node (the missing piece the owner hit),
//     via an injected broadcast — WITHOUT re-acking (the renderer's clearUnread must not loop back
//     into another ackDone; see `onUnreadClear` at the call site, which threads an `external` flag);
//   - deletes the `.seen` file so it is consumed exactly once.
//
// Pure + electron-free (`src/core`): all fs access is behind an injectable seam so it is unit-testable
// and boots from either shell. Tolerant of junk/partial files (a phone mid-write, or an unrelated file
// in the dir, must never break the scan) — mirrors push-grants.ts.
